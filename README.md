# DecisionTreeAlgorithm


### Problem Statement 

### **Objective** : Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

**Overview**: This Project deals with understanding the working of decision trees.The purpose of this project is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.  

**Context and Motivation** : A key challange for a Machine Learning Data Analyst is with data visualization make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets.The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation. The key advantages of decision trees are simple to interpret and understand, requires little data preprocessing and able to hold both numerical and categorical data.

**Technical Stack :** scikit-learn, Numpy Array, Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pydot
